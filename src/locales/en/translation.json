        "description": "I've been working in the world of makeup since 2009. My career developed gradually‚Äîfrom being a makeup artist at a drugstore, to becoming a trainer and instructor, and finally working for prestigious makeup brands. I gained experience on TV sets, music videos, fashion shows, and as an instructor at a makeup school.\nMy years of experience led to the opening of my own studio, where I do special occasion makeup, provide one-on-one lessons, and train future makeup artists.\n\nIn my work, my priority is to bring out and emphasize natural beauty. Every client is an inspiration to me, and makeup is a tool for highlighting their uniqueness. I invite you to book my services ü§ç"
